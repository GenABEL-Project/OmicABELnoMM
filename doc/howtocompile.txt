Must be included:

-g --geno filename		snps in fv (no need for the .fvd/.fvi, both should have the same name!)
-p --phe filename		traits in fv (no need for the .fvd/.fvi, both should have the same name!)
-o --out filename		file where betas will be written in fv (no need for the .fvd/.fvi, both should have the same name!)

Optional:
-n --ngred                     if the file in snp has a different model like direct data genotipic (2 columns per snp) specify -n 2, default is 1
-t --thr			amount of threads to use, use = as the amount of physical processors in the system (max)
