\chapter{Introduction}
\oanomm is a tool for running \acp{GWAS} on large omics data sets in a
computationally efficient manner. It is specifically designed to run
linear regression on thousands of phenotypes (\eg metabolomics data)
for thousands of individuals and millions of (imputed) genotypes
within a reasonable time frame (think days instead of months or
years).
